# ü§ñ Botpress Channel-Web/Examples Directory for MyDCampus Portal
This is the repository for the MyDCampus Botpress Chatbot Channel-Web Examples directory.

The Channel-Web module in Botpress enables the integration of the chat bot into the website or web application, allowing users to interact with the bot through a chat widget.

The Channel-Web module also includes features such as message history, user authentication, and custom styling options (which is extensively used in this project) for the chat widget.

A repository specifically for the examples directory in this module was created because the source control within the Botpress Admin Panel didn't quite suit our development needs. We needed a way to be able to easily track the changes made to the UI of the chatbot to always have the most updated view of what the chatbot would look like. This repository also stores the NLP and Rule-Based flow of the chatbot exported from the admin panel.
 
# ü™õ Installation and usage

You can directly clone this repo into the examples directory in the channel-web directory which can be located at `../botpress/data/assets/modules/channel-web/examples/` (the directory needs to be empty first). After that, the files should be inside the examples directory.

```bash
cd ../botpress/data/assets/modules/channel-web/examples/ # ../ is where you have botpress installed
rm -r * # deletes all the content in the examples directory
git clone https://github.com/pangilinan-patrick/MyDCampus-Channel-Web.git . # clones into the current directory
```

The site is then tested with this link (Botpress must be running and the `.tgz` file has been imported using the Botpress admin site): 
```html
http://localhost:3000/assets/modules/channel-web/examples/MyDCampusPortal.html?botId=draft
```

Please note that this project was developed using `Botpress 12.30.6`

## üìÅ Important Files

üìÇ The `My DCampus Portal_Files` directory contains the assets for the `MyDCampusPortal.html` website. The main CSS file for the website inside the directory is `app.min.css`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üìÑ The chat bot injection script is in `MyDCampusPortal.html` found around `line 520`, or you can just `Ctrl + F + "chatbot script"` to find it. You can also make edits to the sidebar navigation around `line 140` which contains the settings front-end for the chat bot settings.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;üìÑ The main chatbot script and other related scripts are located around `line 650`.

üìÇ The `Themes` directory contains the CSS file for each theme that's used by the chat bot.

üìÇ The `tgz Import Files` directory contains the chatbot NLP and Rule Based flow and is to be imported using the Botpress Admin Panel to work with an up to date chat bot at all times. The current latest version of the chatbot is `v0.11`

üìÇ The `Database Files` directory contains the IT support knowledgebase in the MyDCampus portal website to aid in the chatbot's ability to answer user's queries. The database is to be imported into PostgreSQL which performs better than MySQL which is used by default. A `.env` file is to then be created in the Botpress directory and should be set accordingly:

```bash
# .env file
DATABASE_URL=postgres
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/mydbuddydb
```
