# v0.11 Updates:

- Improved / adjusted NLU models to appropriately take intent
- Improved navigation on continue-flow by separating choices based on session source
- Incorporated back and restart navigation on slot-filling nodes by making back and restart part of the entities, as slot-filling node does not allow intent based navigation to function properly.
